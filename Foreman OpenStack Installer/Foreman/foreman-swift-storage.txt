In the Foreman OpenStack Platform Installer we need to setup puppet first for the pacemaker+haproxy in the host group:

For swift in Advanced Configuration of the Deployment:

    Swift internal vip: A free IP which will be used to rsync the /etc/swift directory between the nodes.

    Swift storage device: device1

    Swift storage ips: <%= @host.deployment.network_query.controller_ips('Storage') %> or <%= @host.network_query.controller_ips('Storage') %>

Then if we want Glance backed by Swift (quickstack::pacemaker::glance, can be done from Advanced Configuration too):

    backend: swift
    swift_store_auth_address: http://192.168.1.150:5000/v2.0
    swift_store_key: da8574029f01e8b1ff27e83c0f7e791d
    swift_store_user: services:glance

Note that the auth address and password are taken from the deployment setup that has been.

Build the rings for account, container and boject for each device and node:

Install the packages needed for Swift storage on the three nodes:

 yum -y install openstack-swift-container openstack-swift-account openstack-swift-object

 systemctl enable openstack-swift-account
 systemctl enable openstack-swift-container
 systemctl enable openstack-swift-object

 systemctl start openstack-swift-account
 systemctl start openstack-swift-container
 systemctl start openstack-swift-object

 systemctl enable openstack-swift-account-replicator
 systemctl enable openstack-swift-container-replicator
 systemctl enable openstack-swift-object-replicator

 systemctl start openstack-swift-account-replicator
 systemctl start openstack-swift-container-replicator
 systemctl start openstack-swift-object-replicator

 systemctl -l status openstack-swift-account-replicator
 systemctl -l status openstack-swift-container-replicator
 systemctl -l status openstack-swift-object-replicator

Start the Swift Proxy service in all the nodes:

  systemctl enable openstack-swift-proxy

  systemctl start openstack-swift-proxy

  systemctl status openstack-swift-proxy


If we need to install Swift Proxy and Swift storage together we need to create a new setup for the replicators in each node.

Create this in the three nodes with the IP of the storage subnet in each host.

Create /etc/rsync-swift_storage.conf (example can be found at /usr/share/doc/openstack-swift-object-1.13.1/rsyncd.conf-sample):

pid file = /var/run/rsyncd.pid
uid = nobody
gid = nobody
use chroot = no
log format = %t %a %m %f %b
syslog facility = local3
timeout = 300
address = 192.168.1.102

[account]
max connections = 2
path = /srv/node
read only = false
lock file = /var/lock/account.lock

[container]
max connections = 4
path = /srv/node
read only = false
lock file = /var/lock/container.lock

[object]
max connections = 8
path = /srv/node
read only = false
lock file = /var/lock/object.lock

Then also /etc/xinetd.d/rsync-swift_storage where 192.168.1.102 is the local IP of the storage network:

service rsync
{
        port = 873
        disable = no
        socket_type = stream
        protocol = tcp
        wait = no
        user = root
        group = root
        server = /usr/bin/rsync
        bind = 192.168.1.102
        server_args = --daemon --config /etc/rsync-swift_storage.conf

}

Now restart xinetd and all the replicators. This process is needed in all the storage nodes.
